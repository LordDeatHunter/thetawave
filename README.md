## Description

Thetawave is an open-source space shooter game, designed to be easily expandable. It is programmed in the Rust Language using the Bevy Engine.

## Instructions

Protect the Earth from invading enemies!

The game is lost when all players have their health bars depleted from taking damage or when the blue defense bar is depleted from letting enemies reach the bottom of the arena.

- Wrenches heal health
- Gems increase fire rate
- Armor negates damage
- Allowing cargo hauler mobs to reach the bottom of the arena heals defense
